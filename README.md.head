# LADSPA Plugins

This is a small collection of very simple LADSPA plugins for my own use. Don't
expect this to be feature-complete, nor particularly user-friendly; I do,
however, strive to keep them stable, so let me know if they unexpectedly crash
in a host. (Save your work frequently!)

Automatically-generated documentation follows below. For ports, review the
source (`plugins.c`).
